## What I do
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning and developing in web3 technologies, I like the idea of Blockchain based games
- ðŸ”­ I also love the idea of PWAs and I like how PWAs can excel web development to another level by making it easy for users to come back to the web app, make it work smoothly and to have capabilities of native apps
- ðŸ’¬ I really liked the idea of Open Source software and like to contribute in such projects from time to time
